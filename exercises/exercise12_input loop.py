# One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs when people provide text instead of numbers. When you
# try to convert the input to an int, you'll get a ValueError. Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Add them
# together and print the results. Catch the ValueError if either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error
# message. Test your program by entering two numbers and then by entering text instead of a number.
